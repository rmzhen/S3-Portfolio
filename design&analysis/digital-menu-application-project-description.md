# Digital Menu Application  
## Introduction  
Mediaan is an international IT company, founded in Heerlen, the Netherlands, in 1969. We  
are in Heerlen, Amsterdam, Düsseldorf, Münchenand Brussel. We believe that technology  
can make a difference in every company. Using smart processes and the newest  
technologies, companies can connect, inspire and grow.  

We deliver technology ranging from mobile apps to back-end services. Quality is of the  
utmost importance to us and our designs are unique. As soon as customers are interested  
in collaborating with Mediaan, but aren't sure of the feasibility of a project, Mediaan will  
offer a Proof of Concept. Currently, Mediaan has an idea for restaurants. However, this can  
only be realised with limited budget. Therefor Mediaan turns to students.  

## Case  
The process in a restaurant is usually the same. Customers get seated, are hand over the  
menu, order drinks and food, consume the drinks and food and finally have dessert. A  
restaurant has a new idea to convert the above process to a digital experience. You will be  
developing the requested proof of concept in an agile fashion. Initially you'll focus on the  
MVP (the most important features) and then continue to flesh out the application.  

### Milestone 1 (the MVP)  
After being welcomed by the staff, a customer takes seat at a table in the restaurant. On  
each table in the restaurant, a QR-code is placed. When a customer scans the QR-code,  
they will be presented with the digital menu of the restaurant. By scanning the QR-code  
and opening the application, the system should register their table and open a new  
session for the duration of the customer's stay.  

The customer should then be able to order from the digital menu. When the customer  
submits their order, it should be sent in real-time to the kitchen staff, who must then  
process the order. They will receive the order in a 'live-view'-screen in the kitchen. The  
system should aid the kitchen staff in organizing their work. A way to see which orders are  
new, processing and completed is preferred.  

### Milestone 2  
The digital menu has a certain structure. Maybe there are categories of dishes, the dishes  
themselves, ingredients of the dishes and their nutritional information. The restaurant  
owner or the chef can administrate the products of the digital menu, in order to keep it up  
to date.

### Milestone 3  
Having all three systems in place, you should be able to implement a inventory/stock  
system which:  
- Notifies/visualizes the current stock of ingredients  
- Removes dishes from the menu if the stock of ingredients is not sufficient  
- Constructs orders for the next order cycle of food  

### Bonus 1  
Create a white label application. Create or refactor the application in such a manner that it  
can be deployed at other restaurants. That means not only should the restaurant be able  
to create their digital menu. They should also be able to upload their logo and create their  
colour scheme. The digital menu application will then always render in the style of the  
restaurant.  

## Technologies  
You will touch upon the following technologies:  
- Webservices / back-end systems  
- WebSockets for real-time communication  
- Front-end development  
- Databases
