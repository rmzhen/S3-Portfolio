## Intro
In semester 3 we are tasked with building 2 full-stack applications with a frontend JavaSctipt framework and an OO backend application framework, 1 as an individual project and 1 as a group project.  

## Individual project
The [Shazzboard](https://github.com/IPS3-Shazzboard) project consists of the following repositories:
- [ShazamService backend (Spring Boot Java)](https://github.com/IPS3-Shazzboard/ShazamService)
- [ShazzBoardFE frontend (Angular)](https://github.com/IPS3-Shazzboard/ShazzBoardFE)

This project also makes use of Auth0 for authentication in all of the repositories mentioned above, with the frontend handling the login and the backend checking if the requests contain a valid token.

- [customer-frontend (React)](https://github.com/Modus-1/customer-frontend)
