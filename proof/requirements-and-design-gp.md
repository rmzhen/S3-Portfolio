## Project analysis
At the start of the project, we had a meeting with our product owners where we discussed the available projects we could work on during this semester. Each project was divided into milestones in which we could work our way to a finished project. Our group chose the Digital Menu Application as our project, of which you can find the project description [here](../design&analysis/digital-menu-application-project-description).

Our group works with the [Agile methodology](./agile-methodology). Each sprint we define/refine user stories, use planning poker to define the load, regularly hold meetings with our stakeholders, and hold retrospectives with the group at the end of each sprint.

## Architectural designs
For the architectural design of the application, we've used draw.io. The design was made as a group and discussed with our product owners As we're using the Agile methodology, some changes within the architecture did happen, like the removal of the manager API and the addition of a gateway. A snippet of the designs are shown down below.

## UI
The frontend designs are made as a group figma. Like with the architectural designs, these are discussed and approved by our product owners. As inspiration for the design of the frontend, we've looked into existing solutions to get a better understanding of a good UX for an application like ours (like Thuisbezorgd en Uber Eats). Down below are snippets of our designs.
