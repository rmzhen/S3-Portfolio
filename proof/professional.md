## Working with our product owners
The way we work with our stakeholder within our group project is with the [Agile methodology](./agile-methodology.md). Each sprint, we will define new user stories and refine existing ones when necessary. We will then discuss these with our product owners and set the priorities tegether with them. These user stories will be worked on in our sprints of ~3 weeks. At the end of each sprint, we will give our product owners a sneak preview of what they can expect from us in the coming sprint presentation to manage their expectation. 

For our communication with our product owners outside of the sprint reviews, we have selected one person to handle the communication with them, should we have any questions about the project with them. We have decided on having one person to handle the communication to avoid causing confusion towards our product owners with many different people with different e-mail addresses communicating with them.

When there were sudden changes that needed to be made, we made sure to discuss them with our product owners in a timely manner. One of these changes was the needed addition of a gateway for the communication between the applications and the APIs. This change was needed, as the lack of a gateway would lead to a security issue, where the user could alter the request sent to the APIs and cause unwanted effects in our backend. We've discussed the issue with our product owners via mail and they agreed to its addition and the changes to the sprint priorities.

In our second to last sprint review, our product owner told us that we had to finish all the leftover tasks and user stories during the last sprint, despite having been told that we only needed to finish milestone 1 in the past. This was impossible for us to achieve with our workforce and the given timeframe and we told them that we could not meet those expectations. After our response, our product owner told us that it was a test to see how we would react to such a sudden change. Our GP teacher adviced us to take the information from our scrum board and use that as argument to explain why it would or wouldn't be possible for us to meet certain expectations.

## Working together as a group
To make sure we can work together as a group, we've set up a [cooperation contract](../docs/cooperation-contract.md), in which we have layed down the rules on how we should work together. 

Besides a cooperation contract, we have also set up our [code of conduct](../docs/code-of-conduct), in which we have decided on issues like our definitions of done, versioning on GitHub and naming conventions within our projects.

## Feedback
Getting regular feedback from stakeholders/product owners is an important part of working with the [Agile methodology](./agile-methodology.md). Therefore I made sure to ask for feedback regularly within my projects. 

Within the group project, we get our feedback during the aforementioned sprint reviews. The feedback we receive are noted down and archived within Feedpulse.

For my individual project I also note down the received feedback and note the down on Feedpulse. Due to certain hiccups during the process of my individual project, I've I have decided together with my IP teacher that I will get more feedback. Thanks to the more regular feedback, the process goes smoother, as I am able to better focus on the smaller issues at hand.
